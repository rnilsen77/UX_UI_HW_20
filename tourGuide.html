            <p class="card-text">Who is the User?
                In order to direct the design of the project first I needed to understand who the user was. </p>
                <p>Understanding the user would allow me to make sure the design is on track to successfully meet their needs.</p>
                <p>To kick off the user research, I conducted user interviews. The results from interviews allowed me to identify </p>
                <p>the major pain points users had in their recent travel planning processes.</p>

            <h5>Interview Findings</h5>
            <p>Based on the user interviews, Users often have comfortable planning habits when it comes to a large trip.</p>
            <p>However, they feel it is hard to balance multiple planned activities and this often causes stress while traveling.</p>

            <p class="card-text">After interviewing participants, I created a user scenario in order to get into the mindset of the user.  </p>
                <p>This helped to understand their journey through travel planning and the pain points they encounter.</p>
                <img src="images/flow2.PNG">
            
            <p>Once a view through the eyes of the user was established, I was able to prioritize features of the products through a Value Proposition.</p>
            <p>This allowed me to truly narrow down what was beneficial to the user.</p>

            <p class="card-text">To start the design process, wireframes were drawn in order to get an idea of what direction to take </p>
            <h5>Paper Wireframes</h5>    
            <p>with the information gathered from the feature prioritization.  </p>

            <h5>Lofi Wireframes</h5>
            <p>Based on the wireframe sketches, some Low-Fidelity wireframes were created and used to do some initial user testing.</p>

            <h1 class="card-title">Test</h1>
            
            <p class="card-text">Based on the LoFi wireframes, Mid fidelity wireframes were created for user testing. Users were given a series of tasks to complete.</p>
            <h5>Updated Wireframe</h5> 
            
            <img src="images/frames3.PNG" class="card-img-top" alt="Research Image" style="width: 500px;" style="align-content: center;">
            <p>Based on the results of the testing the wireframes were itereated upon. This gave us the final version of TourGuide.</p>

            <h1 class="card-title">Final Thoughts</h1>
            
            <p class="card-text">Throughout the design process I developed many vital skills. I learned the importance of stepping back and taking </p>
            <p>a look at your design and that it's okay to scrap the whole design if necessary. Starting over is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
            <p>In this context it allowed me to create a much better experience and something that I was proud of.</p>
